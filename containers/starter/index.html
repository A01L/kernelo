                <h3>Container-based structure</h3>
                <p>Each module or service in Kernelo is presented as a self-contained container, a disciplinarily isolated entity with its own logic, routes, and resources. This approach makes the project structure clean, scalable, and understandable.</p>

                <div class="card bc">
                <h3>Lightweight, yet powerful Router</h3>
                <p>Kerneloâ€™s Router defines routes in a single line - matching URL patterns, extracting dynamic parameters, assigning middle scripts, or even redirecting requests to an independent app inside a container.</p>
